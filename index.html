        <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
        <p>I'm a Year 2 Software Engineering student but I don't consider myself much of a "tech" person. My strengths lie more towards the humanities — I'd love to curl up with a good book — and music. Also an arbitrary fact about me is that my neck is more than 6 inches long. Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk and good luck sleeping with that unsettling fact. Adios baby!</p>
