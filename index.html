        <h4>Welcome to my website!</h4>
        <h4>I'm a Year 2 Software Engineering student but I don't consider myself much of a "tech" person. 
            My strengths lie more towards the humanities — I'd love to curl up with a good book — and music. 
            Also an arbitrary fact about me is that my neck is more than 6 inches long. 
            Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk and good luck sleeping with that unsettling fact. Adios baby!

            In week 2, we learnt how to use selectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly, we learnt about Element Selectors, such as using it on &lt;p&gt.<br>
            Here, I have made ALL paragraph text to have font size 16px!
        </p>
        <p class="often">
            Secondly, we learnt about Class Selectors, which starts with a ".".<br>
            We can use this recurring instances!<br>
            All elements with the class "often" will have a cream-coloured background.
        </p>
        <p id="unique" class="often">
            Finally, we learnt about ID Selectors, which starts with a "#".<br>
            We can use this for unique instances!<br>
            All elements with the id "unique" will be in italics.
        </p>
        <p>
            In week 2, we also learnt how to do positioning!
        </p>
        <p>
            Fixed Positioning is useful for making sure headers/chatbots are always accessible!<br>
            Relative Positioning is useful for positioning relative to its normal position!<br>
            Absolute Positioning is useful for positioning relative to its parents' position!
        </p>
        <div class="absolute-element">
            Absolute <s>vodka</s> Positioning
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="fixed-element">
        Chatbot here (Fixed Position Element)
    </div>
