        <h6>Welcome to my website!</h6>
        <h6>I'm a Year 2 Software Engineering student but I don't consider myself much of a "tech" person. 
            My strengths lie more towards the humanities — I'd love to curl up with a good book — and music. 
            Also an arbitrary fact about me is that my neck is more than 6 inches long. 
            Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk and good luck sleeping with that unsettling fact. Adios baby!

        <p>In week 2, we learnt how to use selectors.
            <ul>
                Firstly, we learnt about Element Selectors, such as using it on &lt;p&gt.
                Here, I have made the colour of ALL paragraph text to be brown!
            </ul>
            <ul class="often">
                Secondly, we learnt about Class Selectors, which starts with a ".". 
                We can use this recurring instances! 
                All elements with the class "often" will have a cream-coloured background.
            </ul>
            <ul id="unique" class="often">
                Finally, we learnt about ID Selectors, which starts with a "#".
                We can use this for unique instances!
                All elements with the id "unique" will have a border around them.
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
